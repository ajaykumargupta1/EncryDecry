File Encryption and Decryption in Java

Welcome to the File Encryption and Decryption project! This project provides a Java-based solution for encrypting and decrypting files to ensure data security.

Overview

This project offers a straightforward implementation for encrypting and decrypting files using Java. It uses a symmetric encryption algorithm (AES) to secure file contents. The encrypted files can be safely transmitted or stored, and decrypted when needed.

Features

Encrypt and decrypt files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Simple command-line interface for file operations
Supports specifying encryption and decryption keys
Ensures file integrity during encryption and decryption

Usage

Ensure that the encryption key used during encryption is the same as the one used during decryption.
The program performs file operations in binary mode to handle any file type.
